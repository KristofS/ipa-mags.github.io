# 1.Overview
Rob@work mini is a simple demonstration and development platform for navigation strategies from Fraunhofer IPA.
The HW development of the rob@work mini is a development based on the open source robot TurtleBot and the data will be made open source here in the RoboPORT repository.
The vision of this Project is to create a user community around this robot, which will be able to build their own robots of this type - further developments of their robots will be mirrored back into into this project, to provide them to all. 
By an increasing demand from the community, it is planed  to provide this robot as a toolkit, delivered directly from the sub-manufacturers.
