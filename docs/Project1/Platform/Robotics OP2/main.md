ROBOTIS OP2 (as known as “DARWIN 2” or DARWIN-OP2”) has been upgraded with greater computational performance compare to ROBOTIS OP (as known as “DARwIn-OP”).  
Despite the change in name the robot may be colloquially still be called “Darwin”. The only major change comes from the upgrade in computational power.  
When ROBOTIS OP was first released it was stated that it supported Windows OS.  
This claim is, and remains, technically true. However, in practice installing Windows is impossible due to the 4GB cap of the embedded SSD from ROBOTIS OP’s PC.  
The scant 4GB made difficult installing the later releases of Ubuntu and significant workaround was required to be able to install the later Linux releases.  
ROBOTIS OP2 upgrade is aimed at eliminating the difficulties relating to computing from the previous generation.  
You can now focus your efforts more into developing the robot and less on devoting resources for computing.

- Visual differences with ROBOTIS OP:  
  - Other than the color difference, the overall appearance remains unchanged.
